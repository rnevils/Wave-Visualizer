# How to Build Wave Visualizer 

Dependencies:

- OpenGL
- GLFW
- GLEW
- Cmake

Download the project from the webpage or github. If you are using Windows or Linux, there should be a sln file to open in Visual Studio.

If using MacOS, you will need to need to build the project first. To do so:

```bash
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake -G Xcode ..
```

- Then a Xcode project file will be created. Open the project in Xcode and click the green triangle to run. (This project was last tested on Mojave)
